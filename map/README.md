### Overview
The Foxhole War Map, also known as the Foxhole Interactive Map, is a community project developed for the game [Foxhole](https://store.steampowered.com/app/505460/Foxhole/). The War Map displays information about the state of the war. This project is developed using the [LeafletJS library](https://leafletjs.com/).
